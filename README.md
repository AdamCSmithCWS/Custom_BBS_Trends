# Custom_BBS_Trends

Example of code required to generate population trend estimates for a custom list of species and regions. 

The estimates are generated by pulling in the model output from the CWS national BBS analysis, and using bbsBayes to generate the trends for custom time-periods etc. 

The main R script here custom_simpl_trend_estimates_example.R provides a starting point.
It works with the species specific folders that are output from the CWS annual BBS analysis.
